rig.js
======

A barepipe platform for node webapps. Rig is a set of middlewares and libraries for webapps based on Express. Considering that performance and quality are very much a matter of clarity, emphasis is made on conciseness of the code and good, reusable design that makes (some) sense.

## So how is this thing useful, again?
It makes it easy to write, configure, and route pieces of code together when you write a web application or a webservice.

## Anything uses this?
Yep, [bookkeepee.com](http://bookkeepee.com:3000) is an example of app that's running rig.
## Okay, how do I start?
Check [this](https://github.com/jarnoux/rig/wiki/Quickstart) very small quickstart, it takes only a few minutes.
